_HAS_TRADITIONAL_ITERATORS -- from 0 to 1 for vector/string pointer iterators
_HAS_TRADITIONAL_POS_TYPE -- from 0 to 1 for streampos same as streamoff
_HAS_TRADITIONAL_STL -- from 1 to 0 to omit old STL functions
_IOSTREAM_OP_LOCKS -- from 0 to 1 for iostream atomic locks
_TLS_QUAL -- from nil to compiler TLS qualifier, such as __declspec(thread)
_USE_EXISTING_SYSTEM_NAMES -- from 1 to 0 to disable mappings (_Open to open)

/*
 * This is the list implementation used by the scheduler.  While it is tailored
 * heavily for the schedulers needs, it is also available for use by
 * application code.
 *
 * list_ts can only store pointers to list_item_ts.  Each ListItem_t contains a
 * numeric value (xItemValue).  Most of the time the lists are sorted in
 * descending item value order.
 *
 * Lists are created already containing one list item.  The value of this
 * item is the maximum possible that can be stored, it is therefore always at
 * the end of the list and acts as a marker.  The list member pxHead always
 * points to this marker - even though it is at the tail of the list.  This
 * is because the tail contains a wrap back pointer to the true head of
 * the list.
 *
 * In addition to it's value, each list item contains a pointer to the next
 * item in the list (pxNext), a pointer to the list it is in (pxContainer)
 * and a pointer to back to the object that contains it.  These later two
 * pointers are included for efficiency of list manipulation.  There is
 * effectively a two way link between the object containing the list item and
 * the list item itself.

/*
 * The list structure members are modified from within interrupts, and therefore
 * by rights should be declared volatile.  However, they are only modified in a
 * functionally atomic way (within critical sections of with the scheduler
 * suspended) and are either passed by reference into a function or indexed via
 * a volatile variable.  Therefore, in all use cases tested so far, the volatile
 * qualifier can be omitted in order to provide a moderate performance
 * improvement without adversely affecting functional behaviour.  The assembly
 * instructions generated by the IAR, ARM and GCC compilers when the respective
 * compiler's options were set for maximum optimisation has been inspected and
 * deemed to be as intended.  That said, as compiler technology advances, and
 * especially if aggressive cross module optimisation is used (a use case that
 * has not been exercised to any great extend) then it is feasible that the
 * volatile qualifier will be needed for correct optimisation.  It is expected
 * that a compiler removing essential code because, without the volatile
 * qualifier on the list structure members and with aggressive cross module
 * optimisation, the compiler deemed the code unnecessary will result in
 * complete and obvious failure of the scheduler.  If this is ever experienced
 * then the volatile qualifier can be inserted in the relevant places within the
 * list structures by simply defining configLIST_VOLATILE to volatile in
 * FreeRTOSConfig.h (as per the example at the bottom of this comment block).
 * If configLIST_VOLATILE is not defined then the preprocessor directives below
 * will simply #define configLIST_VOLATILE away completely.
 *
 * To use volatile list structure members then add the following line to
 * FreeRTOSConfig.h (without the quotes):
 * "#define configLIST_VOLATILE volatile"

 *
 * Delay a task for a given number of ticks.  The actual time that the
 * task remains blocked depends on the tick rate.  The constant

 * rate - with the resolution of one tick period.
 *
 * INCLUDE_vTaskDelay must be defined as 1 for this function to be available.
 * See the configuration section for more information.
 *
 *
 * vTaskDelay() specifies a time at which the task wishes to unblock relative to
 * the time at which vTaskDelay() is called.  For example, specifying a block
 * period of 100 ticks will cause the task to unblock 100 ticks after
 * vTaskDelay() is called.  vTaskDelay() does not therefore provide a good method
 * of controlling the frequency of a periodic task as the path taken through the
 * code, as well as other task and interrupt activity, will effect the frequency
 * at which vTaskDelay() gets called and therefore the time at which the task
 * next executes.  See vTaskDelayUntil() for an alternative API function designed
 * to facilitate fixed frequency execution.  It does this by specifying an
 * absolute time (rather than a relative time) at which the calling task should
 * unblock.
 *
 * @param xTicksToDelay The amount of time, in tick periods, that
 * the calling task should block.
 *

 * See the configuration section for more information.
 *
 * Delay a task until a specified time.  This function can be used by periodic
 * tasks to ensure a constant execution frequency.
 *
 * This function differs from vTaskDelay () in one important aspect:  vTaskDelay () will
 * cause a task to block for the specified number of ticks from the time vTaskDelay () is
 * called.  It is therefore difficult to use vTaskDelay () by itself to generate a fixed
 * execution frequency as the time between a task starting to execute and that task
 * calling vTaskDelay () may not be fixed [the task may take a different path though the
 * code between calls, or may get interrupted or preempted a different number of times
 * each time it executes].
 *
 * Whereas vTaskDelay () specifies a wake time relative to the time at which the function
 * is called, vTaskDelayUntil () specifies the absolute (exact) time at which it wishes to
 * unblock.
 *
 * The constant portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be used to calculate real time from the tick
 * rate - with the resolution of one tick period.
 *
 * @param pxPreviousWakeTime Pointer to a variable that holds the time at which the
 * task was last unblocked.  The variable must be initialised with the current time
 * prior to its first use (see the example below).  Following this the variable is
 * automatically updated within vTaskDelayUntil ().
 *
 * @param xTimeIncrement The cycle time period.  The task will be unblocked at
 * time *pxPreviousWakeTime + xTimeIncrement.  Calling vTaskDelayUntil with the

 * faster and lighter weight binary or counting semaphore alternative.  Actual
 * FreeRTOS semaphores are taken using the xSemaphoreTake() API function, the
 * equivalent action that instead uses a task notification is
 * ulTaskNotifyTake().
 *
 * When a task is using its notification value as a binary or counting semaphore
 * other tasks should send notifications to it using the xTaskNotifyGive()
 * macro, or xTaskNotify() function with the eAction parameter set to
 * eIncrement.
 *
 * ulTaskNotifyTake() can either clear the task's notification value to
 * zero on exit, in which case the notification value acts like a binary
 * semaphore, or decrement the task's notification value on exit, in which case
 * the notification value acts like a counting semaphore.
 *
 * A task can use ulTaskNotifyTake() to [optionally] block to wait for a
 * the task's notification value to be non-zero.  The task does not consume any
 * CPU time while it is in the Blocked state.
 *
 * Where as xTaskNotifyWait() will return when a notification is pending,
 * ulTaskNotifyTake() will return when the task's notification value is
 * not zero.
 *
 * See http://www.FreeRTOS.org/RTOS-task-notifications.html for details.
 *
 * @param xClearCountOnExit if xClearCountOnExit is pdFALSE then the task's
 * notification value is decremented when the function exits.  In this way the
 * notification value acts like a counting semaphore.  If xClearCountOnExit is
 * not pdFALSE then the task's notification value is cleared to zero when the
 * function exits.  In this way the notification value acts like a binary
 * semaphore.
 *
 * @param xTicksToWait The maximum amount of time that the task should wait in
 * the Blocked state for the task's notification value to be greater than zero,
 * should the count not already be greater than zero when
 * ulTaskNotifyTake() was called.  The task will not consume any processing
 * time while it is in the Blocked state.  This is specified in kernel ticks,
 * the macro pdMS_TO_TICSK( value_in_ms ) can be used to convert a time
 * specified in milliseconds to a time specified in ticks.

 * Creates a new software timer instance.  This allocates the storage required
 * by the new timer, initialises the new timers internal state, and returns a
 * handle by which the new timer can be referenced.
 *
 * Timers are created in the dormant state.  The xTimerStart(), xTimerReset(),
 * xTimerStartFromISR(), xTimerResetFromISR(), xTimerChangePeriod() and
 * xTimerChangePeriodFromISR() API functions can all be used to transition a
 * timer into the active state.
 *
 * @param pcTimerName A text name that is assigned to the timer.  This is done
 * purely to assist debugging.  The kernel itself only ever references a timer
 * by its handle, and never by its name.
 *
 * @param xTimerPeriodInTicks The timer period.  The time is defined in tick
 * periods so the constant portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be used to convert a time that
 * has been specified in milliseconds.  For example, if the timer must expire
 * after 100 ticks, then xTimerPeriodInTicks should be set to 100.
 * Alternatively, if the timer must expire after 500ms, then xPeriod can be set
 * to ( 500 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS ) provided configTICK_RATE_HZ is less than or
 * equal to 1000.
 *
 * @param uxAutoReload If uxAutoReload is set to pdTRUE then the timer will
 * expire repeatedly with a frequency set by the xTimerPeriodInTicks parameter.
 * If uxAutoReload is set to pdFALSE then the timer will be a one-shot timer and
 * enter the dormant state after it expires.

/**
 * BaseType_t xTimerResetFromISR( 	TimerHandle_t xTimer,
 *									BaseType_t *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken );
 *
 * A version of xTimerReset() that can be called from an interrupt service
 * routine.
 *
 * @param xTimer The handle of the timer that is to be started, reset, or
 * restarted.
 *
 * @param pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken The timer service/daemon task spends most
 * of its time in the Blocked state, waiting for messages to arrive on the timer
 * command queue.  Calling xTimerResetFromISR() writes a message to the timer
 * command queue, so has the potential to transition the timer service/daemon
 * task out of the Blocked state.  If calling xTimerResetFromISR() causes the
 * timer service/daemon task to leave the Blocked state, and the timer service/
 * daemon task has a priority equal to or greater than the currently executing
 * task (the task that was interrupted), then *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken will
 * get set to pdTRUE internally within the xTimerResetFromISR() function.  If
 * xTimerResetFromISR() sets this value to pdTRUE then a context switch should
 * be performed before the interrupt exits.
 *
 * @return pdFAIL will be returned if the reset command could not be sent to
 * the timer command queue.  pdPASS will be returned if the command was
 * successfully sent to the timer command queue.  When the command is actually
 * processed will depend on the priority of the timer service/daemon task
 * relative to other tasks in the system, although the timers expiry time is
 * relative to when xTimerResetFromISR() is actually called.  The timer service/daemon
 * task priority is set by the configTIMER_TASK_PRIORITY configuration constant.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @verbatim
 * // This scenario assumes xBacklightTimer has already been created.  When a
 * // key is pressed, an LCD back-light is switched on.  If 5 seconds pass
 * // without a key being pressed, then the LCD back-light is switched off.  In
 * // this case, the timer is a one-shot timer, and unlike the example given for
 * // the xTimerReset() function, the key press event handler is an interrupt
 * // service routine.
 *
 * // The callback function assigned to the one-shot timer.  In this case the
 * // parameter is not used.
 * void vBacklightTimerCallback( TimerHandle_t pxTimer )
 * {
 *     // The timer expired, therefore 5 seconds must have passed since a key
 *     // was pressed.  Switch off the LCD back-light.
 *     vSetBacklightState( BACKLIGHT_OFF );
 * }
 *
 * // The key press interrupt service routine.
 * void vKeyPressEventInterruptHandler( void )
 * {
 * BaseType_t xHigherPriorityTaskWoken = pdFALSE;
 *
 *     // Ensure the LCD back-light is on, then reset the timer that is
 *     // responsible for turning the back-light off after 5 seconds of
 *     // key inactivity.  This is an interrupt service routine so can only
 *     // call FreeRTOS API functions that end in "FromISR".
 *     vSetBacklightState( BACKLIGHT_ON );
 *
 *     // xTimerStartFromISR() or xTimerResetFromISR() could be called here
 *     // as both cause the timer to re-calculate its expiry time.
 *     // xHigherPriorityTaskWoken was initialised to pdFALSE when it was
 *     // declared (in this function).
 *     if( xTimerResetFromISR( xBacklightTimer, &xHigherPriorityTaskWoken ) != pdPASS )
 *     {
 *         // The reset command was not executed successfully.  Take appropriate
 *         // action here.
 *     }
 *
 *     // Perform the rest of the key processing here.
 *
 *     // If xHigherPriorityTaskWoken equals pdTRUE, then a context switch
 *     // should be performed.  The syntax required to perform a context switch
 *     // from inside an ISR varies from port to port, and from compiler to

 *
 *
 * Used from application interrupt service routines to defer the execution of a
 * function to the RTOS daemon task (the timer service task, hence this function
 * is implemented in timers.c and is prefixed with 'Timer').
 *
 * Ideally an interrupt service routine (ISR) is kept as short as possible, but
 * sometimes an ISR either has a lot of processing to do, or needs to perform
 * processing that is not deterministic.  In these cases
 * xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR() can be used to defer processing of a function
 * to the RTOS daemon task.
 *
 * A mechanism is provided that allows the interrupt to return directly to the
 * task that will subsequently execute the pended callback function.  This
 * allows the callback function to execute contiguously in time with the
 * interrupt - just as if the callback had executed in the interrupt itself.
 *
 * @param xFunctionToPend The function to execute from the timer service/
 * daemon task.  The function must conform to the PendedFunction_t
 * prototype.
 *
 * @param pvParameter1 The value of the callback function's first parameter.
 * The parameter has a void * type to allow it to be used to pass any type.
 * For example, unsigned longs can be cast to a void *, or the void * can be
 * used to point to a structure.
 *
 * @param ulParameter2 The value of the callback function's second parameter.
 *
 * @param pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken As mentioned above, calling this function
 * will result in a message being sent to the timer daemon task.  If the
 * priority of the timer daemon task (which is set using
 * configTIMER_TASK_PRIORITY in FreeRTOSConfig.h) is higher than the priority of
 * the currently running task (the task the interrupt interrupted) then
 * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken will be set to pdTRUE within
 * xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR(), indicating that a context switch should be
 * requested before the interrupt exits.  For that reason
 * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken must be initialised to pdFALSE.  See the
 * example code below.
 *
 * @return pdPASS is returned if the message was successfully sent to the
 * timer daemon task, otherwise pdFALSE is returned.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @verbatim
 *
 *	// The callback function that will execute in the context of the daemon task.
 *  // Note callback functions must all use this same prototype.
 *  void vProcessInterface( void *pvParameter1, uint32_t ulParameter2 )
 *	{
 *		BaseType_t xInterfaceToService;
 *
 *		// The interface that requires servicing is passed in the second
 *      // parameter.  The first parameter is not used in this case.
 *		xInterfaceToService = ( BaseType_t ) ulParameter2;
 *
 *		// ...Perform the processing here...
 *	}
 *
 *	// An ISR that receives data packets from multiple interfaces
 *  void vAnISR( void )
 *	{
 *		BaseType_t xInterfaceToService, xHigherPriorityTaskWoken;
 *
 *		// Query the hardware to determine which interface needs processing.
 *		xInterfaceToService = prvCheckInterfaces();
 *
 *      // The actual processing is to be deferred to a task.  Request the
 *      // vProcessInterface() callback function is executed, passing in the
 *		// number of the interface that needs processing.  The interface to
 *		// service is passed in the second parameter.  The first parameter is
 *		// not used in this case.
 *		xHigherPriorityTaskWoken = pdFALSE;
 *		xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR( vProcessInterface, NULL, ( uint32_t ) xInterfaceToService, &xHigherPriorityTaskWoken );
 *
 *		// If xHigherPriorityTaskWoken is now set to pdTRUE then a context

/**
 * An event group is a collection of bits to which an application can assign a
 * meaning.  For example, an application may create an event group to convey
 * the status of various CAN bus related events in which bit 0 might mean "A CAN
 * message has been received and is ready for processing", bit 1 might mean "The
 * application has queued a message that is ready for sending onto the CAN
 * network", and bit 2 might mean "It is time to send a SYNC message onto the
 * CAN network" etc.  A task can then test the bit values to see which events
 * are active, and optionally enter the Blocked state to wait for a specified
 * bit or a group of specified bits to be active.  To continue the CAN bus
 * example, a CAN controlling task can enter the Blocked state (and therefore
 * not consume any processing time) until either bit 0, bit 1 or bit 2 are
 * active, at which time the bit that was actually active would inform the task
 * which action it had to take (process a received message, send a message, or
 * send a SYNC).
 *
 * The event groups implementation contains intelligence to avoid race
 * conditions that would otherwise occur were an application to use a simple
 * variable for the same purpose.  This is particularly important with respect
 * to when a bit within an event group is to be cleared, and when bits have to
 * be set and then tested atomically - as is the case where event groups are
 * used to create a synchronisation point between multiple tasks (a
 * 'rendezvous').

 *
 * A version of xEventGroupClearBits() that can be called from an interrupt.
 *
 * Setting bits in an event group is not a deterministic operation because there
 * are an unknown number of tasks that may be waiting for the bit or bits being
 * set.  FreeRTOS does not allow nondeterministic operations to be performed
 * while interrupts are disabled, so protects event groups that are accessed
 * from tasks by suspending the scheduler rather than disabling interrupts.  As
 * a result event groups cannot be accessed directly from an interrupt service
 * routine.  Therefore xEventGroupClearBitsFromISR() sends a message to the 
 * timer task to have the clear operation performed in the context of the timer 
 * task.
 *
 * @param xEventGroup The event group in which the bits are to be cleared.
 *
 * @param uxBitsToClear A bitwise value that indicates the bit or bits to clear.
 * For example, to clear bit 3 only, set uxBitsToClear to 0x08.  To clear bit 3
 * and bit 0 set uxBitsToClear to 0x09.
 *
 * @return If the request to execute the function was posted successfully then 
 * pdPASS is returned, otherwise pdFALSE is returned.  pdFALSE will be returned 
 * if the timer service queue was full.
 *
 * Example usage:
   <pre>
   #define BIT_0	( 1 << 0 )
   #define BIT_4	( 1 << 4 )

   // An event group which it is assumed has already been created by a call to
