_HAS_STRICT_CONFORMANCE -- from 0 to 1 to disable nonconforming extensions
_HAS_TRADITIONAL_IOSTREAMS -- from 1 to 0 to omit old iostreams functions
_HAS_TRADITIONAL_ITERATORS -- from 0 to 1 for vector/string pointer iterators
_HAS_TRADITIONAL_POS_TYPE -- from 0 to 1 for streampos same as streamoff
_HAS_TRADITIONAL_STL -- from 1 to 0 to omit old STL functions
_IOSTREAM_OP_LOCKS -- from 0 to 1 for iostream atomic locks
_TLS_QUAL -- from nil to compiler TLS qualifier, such as __declspec(thread)
_USE_EXISTING_SYSTEM_NAMES -- from 1 to 0 to disable mappings (_Open to open)

 * This is the list implementation used by the scheduler.  While it is tailored
 * heavily for the schedulers needs, it is also available for use by
 * application code.
 *
 * list_ts can only store pointers to list_item_ts.  Each ListItem_t contains a
 * numeric value (xItemValue).  Most of the time the lists are sorted in
 * descending item value order.
 *
 * Lists are created already containing one list item.  The value of this
 * item is the maximum possible that can be stored, it is therefore always at
 * the end of the list and acts as a marker.  The list member pxHead always
 * points to this marker - even though it is at the tail of the list.  This
 * is because the tail contains a wrap back pointer to the true head of
 * the list.
 *
 * In addition to it's value, each list item contains a pointer to the next
 * item in the list (pxNext), a pointer to the list it is in (pxContainer)
 * and a pointer to back to the object that contains it.  These later two
 * pointers are included for efficiency of list manipulation.  There is
 * effectively a two way link between the object containing the list item and
 * the list item itself.

 * The list structure members are modified from within interrupts, and therefore
 * by rights should be declared volatile.  However, they are only modified in a
 * functionally atomic way (within critical sections of with the scheduler
 * suspended) and are either passed by reference into a function or indexed via
 * a volatile variable.  Therefore, in all use cases tested so far, the volatile
 * qualifier can be omitted in order to provide a moderate performance
 * improvement without adversely affecting functional behaviour.  The assembly
 * instructions generated by the IAR, ARM and GCC compilers when the respective
 * compiler's options were set for maximum optimisation has been inspected and
 * deemed to be as intended.  That said, as compiler technology advances, and
 * especially if aggressive cross module optimisation is used (a use case that
 * has not been exercised to any great extend) then it is feasible that the
 * volatile qualifier will be needed for correct optimisation.  It is expected
 * that a compiler removing essential code because, without the volatile
 * qualifier on the list structure members and with aggressive cross module
 * optimisation, the compiler deemed the code unnecessary will result in
 * complete and obvious failure of the scheduler.  If this is ever experienced
 * then the volatile qualifier can be inserted in the relevant places within the
 * list structures by simply defining configLIST_VOLATILE to volatile in
 * FreeRTOSConfig.h (as per the example at the bottom of this comment block).
 * If configLIST_VOLATILE is not defined then the preprocessor directives below
 * will simply #define configLIST_VOLATILE away completely.
 *
 * To use volatile list structure members then add the following line to
 * FreeRTOSConfig.h (without the quotes):
 * "#define configLIST_VOLATILE volatile"

			3) Calling an API function from within a critical section or when

			   not end in "FromISR" from an interrupt.
			4) Using a queue or semaphore before it has been initialised or
